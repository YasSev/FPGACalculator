# FPGACalculator
ComArchProject

This project was part of the bachelor course "Computer Architecure and trusted computing" at University of Basel. 
We implemented a classical caluculator from scratch (gates level) on the "Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA" using Verilog. We have addition, substraction, multiplication, XOR, NAND.
Each input is 8 bits long (binary) and the output is displayed on a 4 digit long seven-segment display (as hexadecimal) and on 16 LED's (as binary).
More details can be viewed in our report file as well in the user manual in the docs folder.
